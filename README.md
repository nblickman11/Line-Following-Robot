# Line-Following-Robot

Hardware Used:   
-motors, chassis, jumper wires, L298N driver, Rasberry Pi Camera, Rasberry Pi Computer, double AA batteries, SD Card.  
-all components put together from scratch.

Software Used:   
-ROS, C++, Python, Ubuntu OS.

How to run the code:    
-Build and Source your ROS Workspace!  
-Run the Camera Driver Node: streams in camera images.  
-Run the Image Filter Node: turn pixels to either white or black so we know where the white line is.  Slice and use only the bottom of the image, and convert it to a ROS image.  
-Run the Line Follower Node: Includes a centroid calculation to publish the correct linear and angular values.  
-Run the Motor Controller Node:  Sends the correct signal to the correct motor over the gpio pins, for the right amount of time.  

Demo:  
-Download .mp4 file to see it live!

Future SLAM:
-run image proc node which subscribes to my camera nodes image_raw and camera_info and then publishes the image (we map the image name to rect color name)
ros2 run image_proc image_proc \
  --ros-args \
  -r image:=/camera/image_raw \
  -r camera_info:=/camera/camera_info \
 -r image_rect:=/camera/image_rect

 ********** SKIP ODOM FOR NOW
-run slam node again, which subscribes to image_rect and camera_info and publishes /odom and /tf.  This allows SLAM to estimate camera position over time.
ros2 launch rtabmap_launch rtabmap.launch.py \
  rgb_topic:=/camera/image_rect \
  camera_info_topic:=/camera/camera_info \
  odom_topic:=/odom \
  frame_id:=camera_link  
*************  

-run the SLAM node. I probably donâ€™t need to remap the naming to image_rect_color, since that name is the same in the launch file.  Maybe same with Odom.  Also \tf not needed since done automatically.
ros2 launch rtabmap_launch rtabmap.launch.py \
   rgb_topic:=/camera/image_rect \
   camera_info_topic:=/camera/camera_info \
   use_odometry:=false \
   rtabmap.subscribe_depth:=false \
   rtabmap.subscribe_odom:=false \
   rtabmap.subscribe_odom_info:=false \
   approx_sync:=true \
   rtabmap_viz:=false  

I went into my launch file: in the /opt directroy:
-i changed the file in 3 spots 

Run from VM:
LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1 ros2 run rtabmap_viz rtabmap_viz --ros-args -r __node:=rtabmap_viz -r __ns:=/rtabmap
