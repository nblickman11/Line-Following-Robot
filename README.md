# Line-Following-Robot

#Hardware Used: motors, chassis, jumper wires, L298N driver, Rasberry Pi Camera, Rasberry Pi Computer.
#Software Used: ROS, C++, Python.

#TO DO
#Build and Source your ROS Workspace!
#Run the Camera Driver Node: streams in camera images.
#Run the Image Filter Node: turn pixels to either white or black so we know where the white line is.  Slice and use only the bottom of the image, and convert it to a ROS image.
#Run the Line Follower Node: Includes a centroid calculation to publish the correct linear and angular values.
#Run the Motor Controller Node:  Sends the correct signal to the correct motor over the gpio pins, for the right amount of time.
